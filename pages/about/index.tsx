      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Since the first time I started coding back in 2018, i was fascinated by
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first programming language was
        <span className="green-text"> Java</span>. Later i tried
        <span className="green-text"> Javascript </span>
        and the more i learned it, the more i loved it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I don&#39;t work on personal projects or don&#39;t study I am
        solving coding challenges in order to stay sharp. I have already solved
        <span className="green-text"> over 250 coding challenges </span>
        from various sites such as Codewars and Leetcode.
      </p>
