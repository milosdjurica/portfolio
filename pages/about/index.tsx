              Since the first time I started coding back in{" "}
              <span className="green-text">2018</span>, i was fascinated by
              programming. ü§Ø
            </p>
            <p>
              My first programming language was
              <span className="green-text"> Java</span>. Later i tried
              <span className="green-text"> JavaScript </span>
              and the more i learned it, the more i loved it. üòç

            <p>
              When I don&#39;t work on personal projects or don&#39;t study I am
              solving coding challenges in order to stay sharp. üí®
            </p>
            <p>
              I have already solved
              <span className="green-text"> over 350 coding challenges </span>
              from various sites such as Codewars and Leetcode. ‚úî
