        <p>
          Since the first time I started coding back in{" "}
          <span className="green-text">2018</span>, i was fascinated by
          programming. ü§Ø
        </p>
        <p>
          First programming language i learned was
          <span className="green-text"> Java</span>. In Java i learned basic
          principles about OOP.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, i experimented a little bit with
          <span className="green-text"> JavaScript </span>
          and the more i learned it, the more i loved it. üòç
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, i am focused on creating{" "}
          <span className="green-text">front-end TypeScript</span> applications
          with <span className="green-text">React/Next.js.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have some experience in building REST API with{" "}
          <span className="green-text">NestJS</span> - progressive Node.js
          framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I don&#39;t work on personal projects or don&#39;t study I am
          solving coding challenges in order to stay sharp. üí®
        </p>
        <p>
          I have already solved
          <span className="green-text"> over 350 coding challenges </span>
          from various sites such as Codewars and Leetcode. ‚úî
        </p>
        <p>
